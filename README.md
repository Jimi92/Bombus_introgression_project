## Introduction
Species hybridization can influence the evolutionary trajectories of species, especially when they encounter new environments. Recent advancements in genomic research over the past two decades have increasingly revealed that introgression serves as a crucial source of genetic diversity. This additional genetic variation has been shown to facilitate adaptive evolution in both animals and plants. Here, we aim to illuminate intrograssion events between bumblebee species using a large multi-continental dataset
